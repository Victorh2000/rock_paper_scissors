# rock_paper_scissors
# We're going to make a simple implementation of grade-shchool classic "rock paper scissors". 
# for the moment we're just goint to play the game from the browser console, but we will revisit this project in a 
# later lesson and add Graphical User Interface with buttongs and text. 
# Assignment
# 1 Start a new Git repo for your project.
# 2 Create ablank HTML document with a script tag (Hint it is best practice to link an external .js file)
#   the game is going to be played completely from the console, so don't worry about putting anything else in there.
# 3 Your game is going to play against the computer, so begin with a function called computerPlay that will randomly
# return either 'Rock', 'Paper' or 'Scissors'. We'll use this function in the game to make the computer's play. Tip:
# use the console to make sure this is returning the expected output before moving to the next step!
# 4 Write a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors. The function should take two paraeters - 
#   the playerSelection and computerSelection and then return a string that declares the winner of the round like so:
#   "You Lose! Paper beats Rock"
